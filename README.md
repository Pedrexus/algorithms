# Algorithms

This repository contains implementations for multiple algorithms with benchmarks in Python.

## What each problem must have:

1. solution implemented with functions / classes
2. correctness tests
3. time complexity charts

## What each problem should have if possible:

1. memory consumption charts: [tracemalloc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html)
2. $\Theta$, $O$ or $\Omega$ time complexity analysis for each impl

## Tech Notes

- The focus is to compare the efficiency of each implementation and not the language. Python is slow and singlethreaded. There is nothing I can do about it.

- Numpy, Scipy and other third party libs can be used for generating data and, eventually, for implementating optimal algorithms in Python.
